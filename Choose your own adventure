I looked back up at %s, her furrowed brows finally relaxing into her naturally kind looking face as she gushed about this new boy she’s seeing, which is kind of icky to you since you have no interest in dating at the moment but you don’t mind it.So, how is %s? you inquired.\nHe’s great! He’s such a gentleman and super sweet, nothing like the other guys I’ve dated before. I met him on this app called ‘Your Desire Is Our Pleasure’ and the name is so fitting. I couldn’t be happier with him!, she exclaimed.\n  Pause. Your Desire Is Our Pleasure. Really? The developers couldn’t think of a better name? And to boot, you’ve never heard of it in all, %i years of my life. Besides that thought, I was a bit interested in the aspect of finding a date for your office’s annual get together at the local bar to get away from the constant nagging from my senior colleagues and superiors for someone my age so I asked %s what how to download this stupid app.\n    How’d you find this app anyways?I prompted.\n    Well, I was filling out this sketchy questionnaire for one of my statistics courses and there was this pop up that was really bright and interesting so I clicked on it and boom, now I have an awesome boyfriend I can hang out with when my handsome and funny best friend can’t, she claimed with a bright gummy smile.",name,nom,r);

Odd. I haven't ordered anything recently, have I? You didn’t think much of it at the time.

I’m only %i, but a little known fact about me is that I was widowed at a young age: cancer, a devastating illness that seemed to come and go as it pleased without remorse. Julia was her name. I grieved her death everyday, but I don’t hold it against anyone for her death and I certainly don’t let it stop me from doing the things I love the most; it feels like something Julia would want for me.\n    And you said that %s and you went on only one date and hit it off instantly?, you asked a little skeptical, knowing how %s likes to bend the truth a lot of the times.\n    Totally. It’s like we were made for each other. He’s my other half I never knew I needed! %s exclaimed gleefully with a sparkle in her eyes, sighing as she wrapped up those memories as only memories.\n   excitement as she’s been pushing me to be more outgoing in my advances in dating, and got up from her seat across from me to the seat right beside me as we began our conquest to fill out the more or less simple requirement space for my new fascination.

Well that’s strange.  I haven't ordered anything recently, have I? You didn’t think much of it at the time. I texted them to just leave it on the counter or in your room and got in your car, turning up the volume as you backed out of your parking spot.

Not that it mattered- she’s always been a kind and loving person who deserves all great things in this world- but she still had a naivety to her that you would hardly see in anyone else. Her innocent and purehearted approach to helping others is something I love about her, even though sometimes that gullibleness gets her into trouble and eventually I or someone else will have to fish her out of it, but it doesn’t happen often enough to fuss over it too much.\n   Do you want to make an account on ‘Your Desire Is Our Pleasure’? she asked, staring pleadingly with her eyes like she always does when she wants something from me.\n   …I don’t see why not, I finally replied after an uncomfortable amount of silence filled the space between each other and seemingly only grew stronger the more she stared me down. She rejoiced and got up from her seat across from me to the seat right beside me as we began our conquest to fill out the more or less simple requirement space for my new fascination. While explaining some of the more nitty gritty details, I remembered a question I forgot to ask %s.\n    So, where was your first date with %s?\n    Oh. Well, if you must know, it was actually down at his cabin in the woods his family owns in Colorado, she answered.\n    Silence went by. Some more silence went by. I looked at her like she had lost her mind, and she probably already had, but you didn’t notice it at first.\n   His cabin? In Colorado? Are you serious? I echoed back.\n   I am, she shot back, still as stubborn as ever.\n   %s, it was your first date and first time ever meeting with this guy. Did you drive all the way to Colorado just to meet this man and stay at his family’s cabin in the woods for the weekend? Are you ok? Do you need help? I grilled her, knowing she would dismiss the matter as a whole but still pushed forward with the question anyways.\n   Yes! I’m fine. I’m a grown woman, Cerian, I know myself and can handle myself pretty well. Wow! Looks like your information is done processing, she exclaimed in an exaggerated manner, clearly annoyed at me.\n	Well I know that, I explained, but I still want to look after you and make sure you're safe. I promised your family that I would when we moved here. I’m not trying to be overbearing, %s, but you know how your parents are. I’m sorry.\n	She hmphed.

There were instructions written in a letter I found at the bottom of the box, but who has time for that? Looking at the rose and elixir, I got an idea. It probably wasn’t a good idea, but no one was around to stop me. Pulling the cork from its place- it was on pretty thoroughly- I placed the rose in the flask with its stem inside the flask, the rose being the perfect size. You didn’t know what to do with the chalk though, so you decided to give it to one of your friends' kids when you see them again. I had completely forgotten about that dating app so I checked it- no results. Guess it wasn’t meant to be, I thought to myself. Maybe it was a miracle %s met %s, or god’s mysterious ways at play.

I opened the box: inside was a red rose, a dark violet liquid in a flask with a cork as its lid, and some plain old chalk, as well as instructions at the very bottom of the cardboard container.
